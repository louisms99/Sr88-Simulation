# Sr88-Rydberg-simulation
GUI based simulation of 3 level singlet and triplet excitation pathways to Rydberg states in Strontium-88, with the capabilities of plotting steady state population probabilities and probe laser transmission, allowing observation of quantum interference effects such as electromagnetically induced transparency.
